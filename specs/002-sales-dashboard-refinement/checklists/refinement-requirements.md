**Created**: 2026-02-25
**Feature**: specs/002-sales-dashboard-refinement/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] CHK001 - Are success criteria explicitly mapped to each primary functional theme (runtime topology, ORM migration, drag-and-drop status updates, tag filter UX, UI system alignment)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001, Spec §FR-003, Spec §FR-005, Spec §FR-008, Spec §FR-011, Spec §SC-001-006]
- [X] CHK002 - Is the scope of removal of leader/worker modes defined for all launch paths, not only module behavior? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001]
- [X] CHK003 - Are all required data-access domains covered for Drizzle migration (sales, tags, comments, users, ingestion metadata) as a single documented list? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003]
- [X] CHK004 - Are contract-generation obligations and codegen ownership requirements explicitly stated in the requirements set? [Completeness, Spec §SC-006]

## Requirement Consistency

- [X] CHK011 - Are status definitions and allowed transitions consistent between user stories, requirements, and planned data model (FR-004, FR-005, FR-014)? [Consistency, Spec §FR-004, Spec §FR-005, Spec §FR-014]
- [X] CHK012 - Do the single-process and schema-first constraints conflict with existing launch-mode names (`leader-launch.ts`, `worker-launch.ts`) in documented requirements? [Consistency, Spec §FR-001]
- [X] CHK013 - Are filtering expectations consistent across board and list usage (same interpretation of OR semantics and suggestion behavior)? [Consistency, Spec §FR-009, Spec §FR-010, Spec §FR-013]
- [X] CHK014 - Is the contract truth source (`back/schema.graphql`) consistently referenced by both backend and frontend requirement sections? [Consistency, Spec §SC-006]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [X] CHK015 - Are all success criteria tied to concrete values or pass/fail thresholds rather than vague statements? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001, Spec §SC-002, Spec §SC-003, Spec §SC-004, Spec §SC-005, Spec §SC-006]
- [X] CHK017 - Are 100% ShadCN usage and 100% single-runtime targets required as project-level verification goals in requirements terms, not just implementation guidance? [Measurability, Spec §SC-004, Spec §SC-005]
- [X] CHK018 - Is there a requirement that defines how OR-match behavior is tested when a typed tag plus existing tags are both selected? [Measurability, Spec §FR-010]

## Scenario Coverage

- [X] CHK019 - Are all required lifecycle scenarios covered for a sale card (initial render, valid move, invalid move, stale-move rejection, refresh recovery)? [Coverage, User Story 2]
- [X] CHK020 - Are both tag-filter modes (existing-tag-only and mixed typed + existing tags) covered as primary requirement scenarios? [Coverage, Spec §FR-008, Spec §FR-009, Spec §FR-010]
- [X] CHK021 - Are acceptance scenarios explicitly covering UI surfaces beyond board (table/list, delayed list, detail, and sidebar shell) as a single coherent flow? [Coverage, Spec §US1, User Story 4, FR-011, FR-012]
- [X] CHK022 - Are requirements complete for zero-tag result behavior and no-match filtering outcomes in normal and empty catalogs? [Coverage, Gap, User Story 3, Spec §FR-008]
- [X] CHK023 - Are onboarding and developer-facing tasks (single-process conversion + Drizzle migration) required before feature rollout in requirements language? [Coverage, Spec §FR-001, Spec §FR-003]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [X] CHK024 - Are edge cases for status conflicts, duplicate drag events, and same-target-column drops explicitly documented? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-005, Spec §FR-007, Clarifications]
- [X] CHK025 - Are race conditions between concurrent operators on the same card explicitly handled outside the stale timestamp rule? [Gap, Spec §FR-007A]
- [X] CHK026 - Are ingestion-update conflicts with local edits and operational fields explicitly constrained to preserve dashboard ownership semantics? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002, User Story 5]
- [X] CHK027 - Are tag suggestion failure modes (empty catalog, network/loader failures, duplicates, trimming/casing) specified for filtering requirements? [Edge Case, Gap, Spec §FR-008, Spec §FR-009]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [X] CHK028 - Are performance and reliability targets stated for both backend and frontend visibility paths in requirements, including sync side effects? [NFR, Spec §SC-001, Spec §SC-002, Spec §SC-005]
- [X] CHK029 - Is accessibility a defined requirement for new/updated board and sidebar components (keyboard and screen-reader interactions)? [NFR, Gap, FR-011]
- [X] CHK030 - Is deployment and verification cadence defined as a requirement for each development phase (build/test/typecheck/build before phase progression)? [NFR, Spec §SC-005, Constitution]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [X] CHK031 - Are external dependencies and environment assumptions explicitly enumerated for new ORM and drag-and-drop workstreams? [Dependency, Spec §FR-003, FR-005]
- [X] CHK032 - Are tag data assumptions (stability of existing tag source, uniqueness, casing rules) consistently defined before implementing multi-select suggestions? [Assumption, Spec §FR-009, User Story 3]
- [X] CHK033 - Are assumptions about authenticated user set and assignment model sufficient for UI and migration design decisions? [Dependency, Spec §Assumptions]
- [X] CHK034 - Are schema-first contract constraints treated as a dependency that all status and filter behavior must conform to? [Dependency, Spec §SC-006]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [X] CHK035 - Are any terms (“ShadCN component standard”, “existing tags”, “refresh-required warning”) defined sufficiently to avoid interpretation drift across implementation teams? [Ambiguity, FR-011, FR-008, FR-007A]
- [X] CHK036 - Are there unresolved tensions between “single process consolidation” and existing code artifacts that imply multi-launch operation? [Conflict, FR-001, FR-005]
- [X] CHK037 - Is the requirement around ESLint migration scope and ownership explicit enough to prevent partial adoption across back and front? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-001]
