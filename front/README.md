# Frontend

- The frontend is built with **React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS**.
- Use `tailwind` utility classes for all new UI work, layouts, and component styling.
- Global base styles are defined in `src/app/styles.css`.

## Layout convention

- Keep the dashboard shell as a left sidebar + main content split.
- Use card-like containers (`rounded`, `border`, `bg-white`, `shadow-sm`) around lists and details.
